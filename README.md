Fetch and Display Data from a Public API Using Fetch API

Built a simple webpage that fetches user data from a public API using the JavaScript Fetch API. Displayed user names, emails, and addresses dynamically on the page. Implemented error handling to show messages when data fails to load and added a reload button to refetch data. Gained hands-on experience with asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, JSON parsing, and error handling in the frontend.
